## About The Project
`Celler can roca` is an script that automates the booking to the waiting list of the restaurant.

Can Roca usually has the full year booked up and by the end of each month they release the following month
from the next year. So its kinda difficult.

This script automatically adds your reservation to the waiting list of all the year and due to cancellations you
can have your booking.

So far is booking for Thursday - Friday - Saturday (Lunch / Dinner)
